**Brady**: https://github.com/brady-j-garvin

Hope to get out of the course: further understanding of students' ways of thinking, especially approaches that differ from the computer science mindset; improved ability to help students strengthen their computation thinking; knowledge that students have finished the class with a better understanding of computer science and better able to incorporate computers into their fields of interest

Project ideas: interactive fiction; interactive music; tile-based video game; physics simulation; multilingual social media with translation aids, minimal CAD interface for a 3D printer

**Aaron**:https://github.com/aschiller8/worksheet-1.git

Hope to get out of the course: I want to learn more about how to code for computers. I have never done this type of thing before and find it interesting.

Project ideas: buliding a website to host biological data that all can access for free and contribute

Hope to get out of the course: I would like to strengthen my logic skills and be able to create simple programs that can represent scientific data. I think learning how to make a video game, musical synthesis software and how recording software is made is the most interesting facets of programming to me.
